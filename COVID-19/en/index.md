Below you will find a collection of infographics on COVID-19. When not created by me, you can find the author(s) credits below the illustration.

# How does the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine work?

The illustration below aims to show, in a colorful, fun and simple way, what does the mRNA vaccine do once injected in our body, and what happens when a human cell encounters the virus with and without the vaccination.

Here you can see an alternative illustration of what happens during vaccination and to our cells when they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease) **with and without the vaccination with the mRNA vaccine.**

mRNA vaccines are not the only type of vaccine available against COVID-19, but for simplicity are the only ones described in this infographics. Approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines include those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

### Why are vaccines useful?

**Vaccination allows our immune system to "remember" the virus. In case of a future encounter, our body will be able to respond to it in a rapid and effective way.**

### What is an mRNA after all? 

Well, while you might have heard of mRNA vaccines in the recent news headlines, mRNA is all but recent. In fact, mRNA has been produced and destroyed by your cells every second since you were conceived, and it's **naturally part of how our body works.**

more illustrations coming soon :)
