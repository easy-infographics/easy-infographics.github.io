Below you will find a collection of infographics on COVID-19. When not created by me, you can find the author(s) credits below the illustration. 
**These illustrations aim to answer specific question asked to me in a clear and simplified way**. 


# Why are vaccines useful?

This illustration aims to show, in a colorful and fun way, what happens when SARS-CoV-2 encounters a human cell. There are three scenarios: before, during and after the vaccination.
**Vaccination allows our immune system to "remember" the virus and in case of a future encounter our body will be able to respond in a rapid and effective way.**


# How does the mRNA vaccine work?

Here you can see what happens to our cells when they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease) **before, during and after the vaccination with the mRNA vaccine.** 
mRNA vaccines are not the only type of vaccine available against COVID-19, but for simplicity are the only ones described in this infographic.

### What is an mRNA after all? 

Well, while you might have heard of mRNA vaccines in the recent news headlines, mRNA is all but recent. In fact, mRNA has been produced and destroyed by your cells every second since you were born, and it's **naturally part of how our body works.**
**You can find a dedicated illustration in the [Cell Biology](https://easy-infographics.github.io/Cell_Biology) section.**
